The image outpainting problem involves extending an existing image in a visually coherent and plausible manner, creating additional content that seamlessly integrates with the original image. This project aims to explore different approaches, with a particular focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs have shown promising results in generating realistic and high-quality images. We also specifically investigate the use of Self-Attention GANs (SAGANs), which incorporate self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and improve image generation quality. By examining various techniques and leveraging course insights, we aim to improve the quality and realism of the generated outpaintings.
